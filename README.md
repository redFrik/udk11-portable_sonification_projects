=========================

Olofsson: Audiovisual programming - Portable sonification projects

In this course we will equip ourselves with sensors, headphones and battery driven minicomputers. This all in order to go out into the world and explore different physical properties via sound. The equipment lets us listen to normally silent phenomenas like light, temperature, magnetism, position, pressure, vibration etc, and the participants will learn how to generate, control or influence sound with realtime data coming from such sensors.
Exactly what data to collect and how it should sound is up to each participant. Demo projects, some sensors and minicomputers ([beagleBone black](http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black)) will be provided. For sound synthesis we will use the open-source programming environment [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io), and for the sensor reading part the popular programming language, [Python](https://www.python.org).
